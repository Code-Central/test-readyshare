                                        "Royalty-Free" means that you don't have to pay to use their resources in your project.<b><u>However, sometimes you still have to give credit to the creator in your game credits.

                                        Note: Even though we don't need to pay for these resources, that doesn't mean that we are allowed to use them in games we plan to sell. Always check the resources "Terms and Conditions" to see exactly what you are allowed to do with them.

                                    <p class="post-open-paragraph">"Open Game Art" is a website that many artists and musicians will post resources that game makers like yourself can add to their games.
                                        <br><br>
                                        When you are choosing a resource, make sure to look and see what they say you are allowed to use their work for.

                                        Some will only let you use it for personal projects while others will also allow you to use it in games you intend to sell.

                                        Always check the fine print! Otherwise, you could get into trouble for using something you weren't allowed to use...

                                        There is only one problem with it, and that is that the file it gives you (MP3) is not usable in the Godot program. So we would need to use a tool like Online Audio Converter to convert the file from an MP3 to a WAV.
                                        <br><br>
                                        If you have trouble with this, ask an instructor for help on converting your file.

                                        To do this, we need to create something called "Variables". Variables are what we use to store values for us that we can ask for by saying the name of the variable.

                                        To create a variable, simply type the word "var" and the name that you want to call the variable:

                                        However, if you are going diagonally then you are going in two directions at once. This will double your speed and cause your sprite to move faster when going diagonally and slower when going straight.

                                        We can fix this by "normalizing" the direction:

                                        A "frame" is a moment when the computer runs all logic checks and then updates the screen with the latest that is supposed to be showing. This happens multiple times a second (hence the phrase "frames per second" or FPS).

The other is "remove_child" which can be a little more dangerous (because it could cause errors in other parts of your code if you're not careful) however it saves any data that you may have set for it (this is good if you just want to hide something, but bring it back later).

                                        Instead we want to press the "Play Scene" button that is to the right of it:

                                        This is because the editor will draw the nodes in the order they are in the Scene area. To fix this, simply drag the Sprite node above the other two nodes:
