                                    <p class="post-open-paragraph">In short, the language that places all the text and images on a website.</p>
                                    <p class="post-open-paragraph">We are going to start by writing the simple starting structure for a website (delete the old message you wrote in the previous section and then follow along).</p>
                                     
                                     <p class="post-open-paragraph">This first tag sets the "document type" and ensures that we are writing in HTML5, which is the latest and most updated version of this language (don't think too much about it, just know that you need it):</p>

                                     <p class="post-open-paragraph">As you'll see in that image, there are two bread parts. One is  &lt;html&gt; which is our "opening" tag and the &lt;/html&gt; which is our "closing" tag. Almost every HTML element uses this format (ex. <b>&lt;h1&gt; &lt;/h1&gt;, &lt;body&gt; &lt;/body&gt;, &lt;etc&gt; &lt;/etc&gt;</b>) with a few exceptions that we will see later in this section.</p>

                                    <p class="post-open-paragraph">Your first code in CSS shall be this:</p>
                                    <img src="./startingIndexTemplate_files/image122.png">

                                    <p class="post-open-paragraph">Your "selector" here is "body", which is all of your text and images. (You know, that really long one we spent all of the last section on that holds your headers, paragraphs, and images?)</p>
                                    <p class="post-open-paragraph">In between the curly braces ("{ }"), we want to add the property to be changed. To start, we'll just change the color in the background (if you don't want to change the background then just set the color to "white" because you should still know how to do this):</p>
                                    <img src="./startingIndexTemplate_files/image140.png">

                                    <p class="post-open-paragraph">Notice that the property is "background-color" followed by a colon (" : ") and then the value? All CSS follows this convention.</p>
                                    <p class="post-open-paragraph">If you save your file, you'll see that the website doesn't change at all… This is because "index.html" doesn't know that it's supposed to be following the rules we set in our CSS file.</p>
                                    <p class="post-open-paragraph">In order to change that, first, we need to go back to the "index.html" tab:</p>
                                    <img src="./startingIndexTemplate_files/image45.png">

                                    <p class="post-open-paragraph">Next, we want to add a new tag inside the "head" element. This will "link" the HTML file to the CSS file:</p>
                                    <img src="./startingIndexTemplate_files/image174.png">

                                    <p class="post-open-paragraph">Don't worry about how that tag specifically works, we will delve deeper into it later in the worksheet when we explain the difference between a "link" tag and something called an "anchor" tag.</p>
                                    <p class="post-open-paragraph">After adding this and saving, you should see your website with a new color in the background!</p>

                                    <p class="post-open-paragraph">There are so many other cool things that we can do now that the CSS file is working! Most of our fun time will be spent on CSS because that's where we make the website look at a place that people should go to.</p>
                                    <p class="post-open-paragraph">The next step is that we want to add more to the stylesheet so that the content isn't so close to the edge of the screen. Go back to the "stylesheet.css"</p>
                                    <img src="./startingIndexTemplate_files/image8.png">

                                    <p class="post-open-paragraph">Within the "body" selector we want to add something called "margin" to move the content closer to the middle of the screen. The properties are "margin-right" and "margin-left" that we will set to 20% each:</p>
                                    <img src="./startingIndexTemplate_files/image184.png">

                                    <p class="post-open-paragraph">"Margin" is part of a larger concept known as the "Box Model", which we will talk about a little later in the project. For now, just know that it helps keep elements separated from edges or other elements.</p>
                                    <p class="post-open-paragraph">The pictures and text are no longer against the edge!</p>

                                    <p class="post-open-paragraph">But that still looks a little weird, we can change the body more to make this appear more professional. We can do this by adding a border around the whole thing to give the body a better feel and help with the fact that everything looks a little off-center.</p>
                                    <p class="post-open-paragraph">We can do that in pieces with a few different "border" rules:</p>
                                    <img src="./startingIndexTemplate_files/borderRule.png" style="width: 594px; height: 124.5px;">

                                    <img src="./startingIndexTemplate_files/image4.png">

                                    <p class="post-open-paragraph">That's looking better! It looks centered in the middle with this border to help show where the content will be. Still could some tweaking though… Everything is resting against the border and that looks slightly weird.</p>
                                    <img src="./startingIndexTemplate_files/image84.png" style="width: 572.25px; height: 487.5px;">

                                    <p class="post-open-paragraph">We can add something called "padding" next. It's very similar to "margin".</p>
                                    <img src="./startingIndexTemplate_files/image63.png">

                                    <p class="post-open-paragraph">This is also part of the "Box Model" concept. (Explained later in this project).</p>
                                    <p class="post-open-paragraph">A quick note on "px" vs "%". It's probably obvious at this point that there are two kinds of sizes being used in the above CSS.</p>
                                    <p class="post-open-paragraph">The basic breakdown is like this:</p>
                                    <img src="./startingIndexTemplate_files/boxModel.png" style="width: 592.25px; height: 124.75px;">

                                    <p class="post-open-paragraph">See how the images have a little space between them and the border now?</p>
                                    <img src="./startingIndexTemplate_files/image50.png" style="width: 579.25px; height: 496.5px;">

                                    <p class="post-open-paragraph">Margin, borders, and padding are all part of the "CSS Box Model":</p>

                                    <p class="post-open-paragraph">For now, we are done adding rules to the "body" element. We are now going to change the properties for the "h1" element.</p>

                                    <p class="post-open-paragraph">We need to create some consistency in the width and height of our images.</p>
                                    <p class="post-open-paragraph">We can do that by changing the "width" and "height" properties to a fixed size for all "&lt;img&gt;" elements (feel free to mess around with these values, 50% and 25% worked well with the images that were in this worksheets website. You may find different values work well for you):</p>

                                    <p class="post-open-paragraph">Finally, let's center the image!</p>
                                    <p class="post-open-paragraph">This requires a little more explanation, we want to start by altering the "display" property:</p>
                                    <img src="./startingIndexTemplate_files/image131.png">

                                    <p class="post-open-paragraph">The "display" property of an image is defaulted to "inline". "Inline" means that the image can share the same line as other elements (having text right next to the image). However, that makes it where we cannot center the image as it needs to line up with the other text that may be around it.</p>
                                    <p class="post-open-paragraph">"Block" (which is what we set our "display" property to) means that the image is guaranteed it's own line (just like a &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; or &lt;h1&gt; &lt;/h1&gt; tag). This also means that it has the full width of that line all to itself.</p>
                                    <p class="post-open-paragraph">Next, we want to set the margins on the left and right to be set to "25%". This forces the image to stay in the center:</p>
                                    <img src="./startingIndexTemplate_files/image3.png">
                                   
                                    <p class="post-open-paragraph">If that doesn't completely make sense then that's okay! Just remember that this is the code to center your image and then you're set!</p>
